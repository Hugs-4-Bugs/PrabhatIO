## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to evoke trust and sophistication, complementing a developer's profile without being clich√©.

- Accent color: Violet (#9FA8DA), slightly different from the primary, in order to pop but not clash.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern and fashionable look.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) as it pairs very well with the Headline and gives better readibility.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets clearly.
- Use a consistent style of minimalistic icons throughout the site.

- Subtle animations for page transitions, hovers, and content loading to create a smooth user experience.
